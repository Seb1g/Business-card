# Anemone Holding

Hello! This is my personal business card website, which I developed to demonstrate my skills. The project is constantly evolving, and I add new useful functions to it.

## About project

This business card site is not just a portfolio, but also a live project where I experiment with new technologies and ideas. Currently, the site already has a disposable email service.

### **Current capabilities:**
* **AnemoneMail:** Create temporary email addresses for website registrations and avoid spam.

### **Plans for the future:**
* **AnemoneBoard:** I plan to add a simple service for organizing tasks.
* **AnemoneNotes:** It will be possible to create and structure your notes directly on the site.
* **AnemoneQuizlett** This is a quiz where you can test your knowledge of some things. Video games, movies, literature, art, etc.

## Technologies used

The project was created using modern technologies for fast and efficient development..

* **Framework:** React
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Project Builder:** Vite
